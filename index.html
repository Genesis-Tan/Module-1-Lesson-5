      </div>

      <p>No one knows for sure who first invented such money, but
        historians believe metal objects were first used as money as early
        as 5,000 B.C. Around 700 B.C., the Lydians became the first Western
        culture to make coins. Other counties and civilizations soon began
        to mint their own coins with specific values.</p>

      <p>Today, most modern currency is not backed by silver or gold, Instead, today's
        money is known as fiat money. Fiat is a Latin word that means "let it be done."
        Money has a certain value today because it was given that value by government
        fiat or decree. Legal tender laws now make it illegal to refuse legal currency
        in favor of some order form of payment.</p>

      <p>The first paper money issued in the United States occured on March 10, 1862.
        The $5, $10, and $20 bills issued were made legal tender by an act of Congress
        on March 17,1862.</p>
